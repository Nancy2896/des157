A quick background of my app is that I want to make a app/website which caters to people who have a passion for baking like me. I love watching YouTube videos and baking in my pastime; the problem which I mostly encounter is that I sometimes cannot find some ingredients in the near by stores. This generally happens when a youtuber or a book includes a special ingredient in their recipe. I want to make an app which tells the person which is the nearest store that sells that product. If the product is not found in the nearest stores than the app will suggest a substitute of the ingredient. The app will also show some interesting baking recipes the person can make.

The feedback I received for my first drawing from Nitin is that it was very easy to understand my idea when looking at my illustration. Nitin said that the correlation between finding the ingredients and the grocery store made him understand the idea quickly. 
He said if I could include or integrate the last illustration of the first storyboard of adding recipes into my project more properly, it would help the user use all the additional advantages(recipes) the app offers.

    The feedback I got for my second drawing is that there was too much text to explain the illustration. If I lessed the text and focused more on the illustration
    then the person would may be able to understand my idea better. 
    The seond feedback was better than the first as it helped me understand how to communicate my ideas visually better.
