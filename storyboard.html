A quick background of my app is that I want to make a app/website which caters to people who have a passion for baking like me. I love watching YouTube videos and baking in my pastime; the problem which I mostly encounter is that I sometimes cannot find some ingredients in the near by stores. This generally happens when a youtuber or a book includes a special ingredient in their recipe. I want to make an app which tells the person which is the nearest store that sells that product. If the product is not found in the nearest stores than the app will suggest a substitute of the ingredient. The app will also show some interesting baking recipes the person can make.

The feedback I received from another student is that it was very easy to understand my idea when looking at my illustration. The student said that the correlation between finding the ingredients and the grocery store made him understand the idea better. He said if I could include or integrate the last illustration of adding  recipes more properly, it would enhance or make my app better.
