<h1> Background Research</h1>

<p>A quick background for my final project app is that I want to make a app/website which caters to people who have a passion for baking like me. I love watching YouTube videos and baking in my pastime; the problem which I mostly encounter is that I sometimes cannot find some ingredients in the near by stores. This generally happens when a youtuber or a book includes a special ingredient in their recipe. I want to make an app which tells the person which is the nearest store that sells that product. If the product is not found in the nearest stores than the app will suggest a substitute of the ingredient. The app will also show some interesting baking recipes the person can make.
</p>
<p>
For my background research I came across this &#34;Healthy Baking Alternatives&#34; article which tells me about substituting/replacing unhealthy ingredients with healthy, nutritive ingredients. I think that&apos;s a great idea as nowadays people have become very health conscious and substituting fatty ingredients with healthy ones would be better for the persons well being. The article elaborates on how one can add more fruits to their recipes, swap butter with healthy heart oil, use low fat dairy products, use whole grain flour instead of white flour, experiment with recipes that use less common flours. The article also explains the health benefits the nutritive ingredients bring to one&apos;s dessert. For instance, using low-fat milk, low-fat buttermilk and low-fat yogurt, could help contribute protein and calcium to any food; we can in fact choose protein rich Greek yogurt over cheese frosting. I think the article gives me very useful information about ingredients substitution that I can add to my app.

The second article, &#34;11 Things You Need to Do to Make Your Baked Goods Better&#34;, talks about some tips which a baker can easily apply to make their dessert&apos;s taste delightful. The article elaborates on basic baking tips such as using ingredients at room-temperature; weighing each and every ingredient perfectly as baking requires one to be errorless when measuring their goods; paying special attention to details in your method such as &#34;beat until your batter is light and fluffy&#34; etc. This article makes me analyze and gives me a deeper understanding of my target audience, I say that it gives me a deeper understanding of my target audience because earlier I was only thinking of catering to people with the knowledge of baking but now after reviewing this article I feel that I can have a page on my app catering towards tips for beginner&apos;s. Overall the article gives a deep analysis of how basic baking steps can make a simple dessert taste delicious.

The third article, &#34;Where to shop for baking supplies&#34; explores the fact that which grocery stores are usually chosen by the buyer for a particular ingredient. This article gives me an insight on which stores are selected to buy basic ingredients and which stores are selected to buy special ingredient. For example, basic ingredients like sugar, flour etc. can be bought from a baking aisle of any well known grocery store such as Walmart whereas special ingredients need to be bought from specialty stores such as Michaels. The article also covers online website which have every possible ingredient and utensils such as King Arthur and Amazon, yet sometimes people don&apos;t prefer online stores because of shipping time. Overall the article gives me a good idea about which stores people prefer to go to; giving me a clearer idea of which stores should my app focus on.
