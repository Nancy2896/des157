<h1> Audience Test Results</h1>

<p> Me and my team member Nitin learnt a lot from this audience testing. We got good feedback on what is not working and what changes can we make to make the interface look better. </p>

<p>First Audience Tester- <br>
From the first tester we got the feedback to look at other food websites home page and make appropriate change to ours. We took her advice and removed the nav bar blocks/imges below the slideshow</p>

<p>Second Audience Tester-<br>
From the second tester we got the feedback to make the slideshow automatic so that the user doesnt have to click each time when viewing the site. We made appropriate changes.</p>

  <p>Third Audience Tester-<br>
  From the third tester we got the feedback to add description to our recipes page. Considering the testers suggestion we added a brief description of the recipe, each time one hovers over the images.</p>
