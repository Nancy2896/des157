  <h1>Project Brief </h1>


<h3>Topic Summary </h3>
<p>
A quick background for my final project app is that I want to make a app which caters to people who have a passion for baking like me. I love watching baking videos on YouTube and then baking those recipes in my pastime; during this process I sometimes get stuck, that is I don &#39;t have that particular ingredient mentioned in the recipe or when I cannot find that ingredient in the near by stores. This generally happens when a youtuber or a book includes a special ingredient in their recipes. I want to make an app which tells the person which is the nearest store that sells that product. If the product is not found in the nearest stores than the app will suggest a substitute of the ingredient. The app will also show some interesting baking recipes the person can bake.
</p>

<h3>Target Audience Description </h3>
<p>
According to my research, people of young generations are more into sweets/pastries than the old generations. I say this because young generations don &#39;t have much health issues like diabetes which the old generation may have or need to be careful about. Therefore, my target audience would be youth that includes children, school as well as college going students.

<h3> The Goals of the Project (And How It Will Work)
</h3>
<p>
The goals of the project would be to make people lives (who love baking) easier. The goal would be to make them get the right ingredient for their recipes by either telling them the location of the store of where they can purchase it or telling them the substitute for it.
My rough idea about how I would go about this would be by using map library of JavaScript. As the map library would help set locations of the nearest stores where the ingredient would be available. I will be using basic Html and CSS for structure, styling, and visual appeal.

<h3>
Communication Strategy
</h3>
<p>
As far as communication goes I want by app to be very simple so that the user gets the message or the function easily. It would be very straight ford in terms of directions that is which tab will give one what options. Ill also keep in mind to make “what is clickable” and what is not clear, so that the user doesn &#39;t struggle clicking on different areas. On my home page, there will be a brief about what the app does so that the user can decide if they need to use it or not.


</p>

<h3>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel (Visual Strategies, such as Formal Details including Color and Type)
 </h3>
<p>
The overall look of the app would be very minimal with high resolution photographs. I choose high resolution photos as even if the user doesn &#39;t want to use the app, it will make them scroll further due to its visual appeal. There will be the basic navigation bar on the top, for mobile view ill use the hamburger icon. My colors would be tones of black and white; although baking apps are mostly colorful, choosing this minimal look would again make my app unique and different from other applications.
